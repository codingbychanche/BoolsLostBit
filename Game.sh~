# Bools Lost Bit V1.0
#
# A clasical adventure game where you have to find a mystical
# hidden object featuring a 2- level 2d map which is generated 
# from the players name.
#
# The algorithms are based on the technique used in the game 
# 'Pitfall 1'
#
# An in depth discusion about the LFSR used can be found at:
# http://meatfighter.com/pitfall/
#
# Needs Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17) for:
# o Calculating a 8- bit hash value from the dungeon masters name (see line 530)

#
# Player movement on map
#
# This is achieved by shifting the LFSR.
# For left (West) and right (East) movement the LFSR is shifted once 
# either to the left ('<<') or to the right ('>>')
#
# For up (North) or down (South) movement we have to shift the LFSR
# multiple times to the left or to the right. Number of shifts equals
# the # of rows of the map.
#
# For up and down movement (entering and leaving a dungeon) the LFSR 
# is shifted equal to the map size (e.g. 10 x 10 map = 100 times).
# The result is a new map sized (in this example size=10 x 10).
# Remember: Map size is deffined by the 'mapx' and 'mapy' vars.
