Bools Lost Bit
--------------
A classical text adventure game for the bash shell.  
The map is created depending on the name of the dungeon master you choose. 

Abstract
--------
Your task: Find Bools Lost Bit which is hidden somewhere on a 2d map. You start in the wilderness.
Here, each move you make takes one step. Dungeons are shortcuts. Each move in the dungeon takes
two steps thus making  you move faster. Once in a while you find water, fire or hints about in which 
direction the lost bit can be found. If you run out of water, you die. If you run out of fire, you
cant see anything and may run into traps! Your goal is to find the lost bit in the fewest possible
number of steps.

Good luck!
